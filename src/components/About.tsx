                My name is Paul Serafimescu and I'm a freshman Computer Science and Engineering major at UCLA.

                In the past, I have job shadowed at vCom Solutions where I was introduced to C# .NET and MVC architecture,
                and built a grades app utilizing Microsoft Entity Framework and .NET Core on the backend.
                I have also interned with Sonoma State University conducting research on 5G wave propagation.
                My interests include full stack web development and machine learning.
              </p>
              <p className="lead">
                Outside of writing code, I enjoy reading, particularly about economic theory and law (or the intersection of the two!),
                hiking Sonoma County, and playing Rachminov and Chopin on the piano.
